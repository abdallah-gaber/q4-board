# Roadmap

## Phase 1 (Completed / Ongoing polish)

- Local-first Eisenhower board
- Hive persistence
- Responsive board UX
- AR/EN localization
- Theme switching
- Ongoing UI polish (icons, splash, docs, test hardening)

## Phase 2 (In Progress)

- Firebase anonymous auth integration
- Firestore-backed manual sync (Push / Pull)
- Live remote-to-local sync listener and app-resume auto-pull
- Conflict handling basics (last-write-wins with safety checks)
- Selective sync controls and persisted sync status metadata
- Next: richer conflict UX (per-note visibility / resolution affordances)

## Phase 3+ (Candidate)

- Advanced reporting and insights
- Keyboard-first desktop flows
